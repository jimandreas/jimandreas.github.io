A best-effort recreation of the chili from Rube's — built on beef chuck, dried spices bloomed in fat, and a long slow simmer that lets the collagen do its work.

## Ingredients

### Chili Base
- 2 lbs beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil (or beef tallow for extra richness)
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 can (14.5 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp brown sugar
- Salt and black pepper to taste

### Spice Blend (for blooming)
- 3 tbsp chili powder (a blend of ancho and guajillo is ideal)
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 0.5 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to heat preference)
- 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp onion powder
- 0.25 tsp ground black pepper

### Optional Additions
- 1 can (15 oz) kidney beans or pinto beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced
- 1 dried chipotle pepper, rehydrated and minced (for smokiness)

### For Serving
- Shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- Sour cream
- Diced white onion
- Saltine crackers or cornbread

## Steps

### 1. Cut and season the chuck
Trim any large pieces of exterior fat from the chuck roast, but don't be obsessive — the intramuscular fat is what makes this chili rich. Cut into rough 1/2-inch cubes. Season generously with salt and pepper.

### 2. Brown the beef
Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches to avoid crowding, sear the chuck cubes on at least two sides until deeply browned — about 3-4 minutes per batch. Don't rush this. The fond (browned bits on the pot bottom) is flavor you're building on. Transfer browned meat to a plate and set aside.

### 3. Bloom the spices
This is the most important step for getting that round, mellow chili flavor. Reduce heat to medium. Add the diced onion to the pot and cook in the rendered fat for 4-5 minutes until softened and translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook 1 minute more. Now add the entire spice blend — chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper — directly into the fat and onions. Stir constantly for 60-90 seconds. The spices will darken slightly and become intensely fragrant. This transforms them from sharp and raw-tasting into something integrated and complex. Don't skip this.

### 4. Build the liquid
Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and beef broth. Stir well, scraping up all the fond from the bottom of the pot. Add the apple cider vinegar and brown sugar. Return the browned chuck and any accumulated juices to the pot. The liquid should just barely cover the meat — add a splash more broth if needed.

### 5. Simmer for 90 minutes
Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a low, steady simmer. Cover with the lid slightly ajar. Cook for 90 minutes, stirring occasionally. The chuck will go from tough to fork-tender right around the 90-minute mark as the collagen breaks down. The sauce will thicken naturally as it reduces and the beef releases its gelatin. If it gets too thick before the meat is tender, add a splash of broth. If it's too thin at the end, remove the lid and simmer uncovered for 10-15 minutes.

### 6. Adjust and finish
Taste the chili carefully. This is where you dial it in. If it's too tomato-forward, add another teaspoon of cumin and a pinch more chili powder. If it's missing richness, a tablespoon of butter stirred in at the end rounds everything out. If it needs brightness, another splash of vinegar will lift it. Season with salt — it probably needs more than you think. If using beans, add them in the last 20 minutes of cooking so they heat through without falling apart.

### 7. Rest and serve
Kill the heat and let the chili rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Like most braises, it improves as it sits — the flavors continue to meld and the sauce tightens up. Serve in deep bowls topped with shredded cheddar, a dollop of sour cream, and diced white onion. Saltines or cornbread on the side.

## Notes

**On the chuck:** Beef chuck is non-negotiable here. Ground beef makes a different (and lesser) dish. The 90-minute simmer is what turns tough, collagen-rich chuck into something that falls apart on contact. The gelatin released during cooking is what gives the sauce its body and lip-coating richness — no amount of thickener can replicate it.

**On spice blooming:** Cooking dried spices in hot fat before adding liquid is the single technique that separates flat-tasting chili from the good stuff. The fat-soluble flavor compounds in cumin, chili powder, and paprika only fully release when heated in oil. Sixty to ninety seconds is all it takes.

**On adjusting to taste:** If something feels off from what you remember, the easiest knobs to turn are cumin (earthiness), chili powder (depth and warmth), tomato paste (richness), and vinegar (brightness). Small adjustments make a big difference — add a half teaspoon at a time and re-taste.

**On the second day:** This chili is better on day two. The flavors deepen overnight in the fridge, and the sauce thickens further as the gelatin sets. Reheat gently over medium-low, adding a splash of broth if needed to loosen it back up.

**On beans:** Whether chili should have beans is a matter of deep personal conviction. If Rube's had them, add kidney or pinto beans in the last 20 minutes. If not, leave them out and let the chuck be the star.
