Fred Brooks' "The Mythical Man Month[^1]" was one of my favorite books from way
back when. His themes of the "Second System Effect" still ring true as often in
corporate life a new system is introduced that will 
"fix all the bugs in the previous system" only
to reveal a new set of problems that users have to live with.   And the old rule of
"Adding more programmers to a team makes a late project later" was also a true-ism.
The Chief Programmer Team model, originally from IBM[^2], was also discussed by
Brooks as a way to reduce the communication overhead of a larger team while 
working productively on a complex project.  One key factor of this model is the 
support staff that work on the details of the project for the Chief Programmer.

The [Baker paper[^3]] discusses the notion of a development support library (DSL) to
speed up production by leveraging previously written and tested "machine code" 
that could be reused by the Chief Programmer.  It also introduced the role of a
"Programming Secretary" that helped, among other things, maintain the 
DSL.

Fast forward to 1981.  The UN*X movement was in motion, and I eagerly explored the
UN*X kernel and drivers through courses at Oregon State University.  I even had a
UN*X "[Live Free Or Die](https://unix.org/license-plate.html)" coffee cup.  And 
if you are a UN*X Geek, then you get started with the "[Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)".
