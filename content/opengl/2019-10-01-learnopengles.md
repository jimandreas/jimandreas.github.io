## Learning OpenGL ES2 on Android systems

I started tinkering with OpenGL on Android by reading the book **OpenGL ES 2 for Android: A Quick-Start Guide** written by Kevin Brothaler. It was the first major source of information on OpenGL on the Android platform that I had found.

The exercise that deals with [vertex buffer objects](https://www.learnopengles.com/android-lesson-seven-an-introduction-to-vertex-buffer-objects-vbos/) was one that I found to be particularly helpful, as my goal is to visualize as many atoms as possible on an Android device.

A link to my Github repository that has my worked examples of the exercises is:
