      XXXII. An Account of the Success of the
      Bark of the Willow in the Cure of Agues.
      In a Letter to the Right Honourable George
      Earl of Macclesfield, President of R.S.
      from the Ref. Mr. Edmund Stone, of
      Chipping-Norton in Oxfordshire.
      [Read June 2nd, 1763]
      </em>

      My Lord,
      <p>
      Among the many useful discoveries,
      which this age hath made, there
      are very few which, better deserve the attention of the
      public than what I am going to lay before your
      Lordship.
      </p><p>
      There is a bark of an English tree, which I have
      found by experience to be a powerful astringent, and
      very efficacious in curing aguish and intermitting
      disorders.
    </p><p>
      About six years ago, I accidentally tasted it, was
      surprised at its extraordinary bitterness; which immediately
      raised me a suspicion of its having the
      properties of the Peruvian bark. As this tree delights
      in a moist or wet soil, where agues chiefly abound,
      the general maxim, that many natural maladies carry
      their cures along with them; or that their remedies
      lie not far from their causes, was so very apposite to
      this particular case, that I could not help applying it;
      and that this might be the intention of Providence here,
      I must own had some little weight with me.
    </p><p>
      The excessive plenty of this bark furnished
      me, in my speculative disquisitions upon it, with an argument
      both for and against the imaginary qualities
      of it; for, on one hand, as intermittents are
      very common, it was reasonable to suppose, that what
      was designed for their cure, should be as common and
      as easy to be procured. But then, on the other hand,
      it seemed probable, that, if there was any considerable
      virtue in this bark, it must have been discovered from
      its plenty. My curiosity prompted me to look into
      into the dispensatories and books of botany, and examine
      what they said concerning it; but there it existed
      only by name. I could not find, that it hath, or
      ever had, any place in pharmacy, or any such qualities,
      as I suspected ascribed to it by the botanists.
    </p><p>
      However, I determined to make some experiments
      with it; and, for this purpose, I gathered that summer
      near a pound weight of it, which I dryed in a bag,
      upon the outside of a baker’s oven, for more than three
      months, at which time it was to be reduced to a powder,
      by pounding and sifting after the manner
      that other barks are pulverized.
    </p><p>
      It was not long before I had an opportunity of
      making a trial of it; but, being an entire stranger to its
      nature, I gave it in very small quantities, I think it
      was about twenty grains of the powder at a dose, and
      repeated it every four hours between the fits; but with
      great caution and the strictest attention to its effects:
      the fits were considerably abated, but did not entirely
      cease. Not perceiving the least ill consequences, I grew
      bolder with it, and-in a few days encreased the dose
      to two scruples, and the ague was soon removed.
    </p><p>
      It was then given to several others with the same
      success; but I found it better answered the intention,
      when a dram of it was taken every four hours in the
      intervals of the paroxisms.
    </p><p>
      I have continued to use it as a remedy for agues
      and intermitting disorders for five years successively
      and successfully. It hath been given I believe to fifty
      persons, and never failed in the cure, except in a few
      autumual and quartan agues, with which the patients
      had been long and severely afflicted; these it reduced
      in a great degree, but did not wholly take them off;
      the patient, at the usual time for the return of his fit,
      felt some smattering of his distemper, which the incessant
      repetition of these powders could not conquer :
      it seemed as if their power could reach thus far
      and no farther, and I did suppose that it would not
      have long continued to reach so far, and that the distemper
      would have soon returned with its pristine
      violence; but I did not stay to see the issue: I added
      one fifth part of the Peruvian bark to it, and with
      this small auxiliary it totally routed its adversary.
      It was found necessary likewise, in one or two obstinate
      cases, at other times of the year, to mix the same
      quantity of that bark with it; but these were cases
      where the patient went abroad imprudently, and,
      caught cold, as a post-chaise boy did, who, being
      almost recovered from an inveterate tertian ague,
      .would follow his business, by which means he not
      only neglected his powders, but, meeting with bad
      weather, renewed his distemper.
    </p><p>
      One fifth part was the largest and indeed the only
      proportion of the quinquina made use of in this
      composition, and this only upon extraordinary occasions:
      the patient was never prepared, either by vomiting,
      bleeding, purging, or any medicines of a
      similar intention, for the reception of this bark, but
      he entered upon it abruptly and immediately, and it.
      was always given in powders, with any common vehicle,
      as water, tea, small beer and such like. This
      was done purely to ascertain its effects; and that I
      might be assured the changes wrought in the patient
      could not be attributed to any other thing: though,
      had there been a due preparation, the most obstinate
      intermittents would probably have yielded to this bark
      without any foreign assistance: And, by all I can
      judge from five years experience of it upon a number
      of persons, it appears to be a powerful absorbent,
      astringent, and febrifuge in intermitting cases, of the
      same nature and kind with the Peruvian bark, and to
      have all its properties, though perhaps not always in
      in the same degree. It seems likewise to have this additional
      quality, viz. to be a safe medicine; for I never
      could perceive the least ill effect from it, though it
      had been always given without any preparation of
      the patient.
    </p><p>
      The tree, from which this bark is taken, is stiled
      by Ray, in his Synopsis, Salix, alba, vulgaris, the
      common white Willow. Haec omnium nobis cognitarum
      maxima est, et in satis crassam et proceram Arborem adolescit.
      [Google translate: This is the largest known to us all, and quite thick timber tree grows.]
    </p><p>
      It is called in these parts, by the common people,
      the willow, and sometimes the Dutch willow; but,
      if it be of a foreign extraction, it hath been so long
      naturalized to this climate, that it thrives as well a
      in it as if it was in its original soil. It is easily distinguished
      by the notable bitterness and the free running
      of its bark, which may be readily separated from it
      all the summer months whilst the sap is up.  I took
      it from the shoots of three or four years growth, that
      sprung from Pollard trees, the diameters of which
      shoots, at their biggest end, were from one to four or
      five inches: it is possible, and indeed not improbable,
      that this cortex, taken from larger or older shoots, or
      from the trunk of the tree itself, may be stronger;
      but l have not had time nor opportunities to make
      the experiments, which ought to be made upon it.
      The bark, I had, was gathered in the northern parts
      of Oxfordshire, which are chiefly of dry and gravelly
      nature, affording few moist or moory places for this
      tree to grow in; and therefore, I suspect that its bark
      is not so good here as in some other parts of the kingdom.
      Few vegetables are equal in every place; all
      have their peculiar soils, where they arrive to a greater
      perfection than in any other place: the best and
      strongest Mustard-seed is gathered in the county of
      Durham; the finest Saffron-Flowers are produced
      in some particular spots of Essex and Cambridgeshire;
      the best Cyder-apples grow in Herfordshire, Devonshire
      and the adjacent counties; the roots of
      Valerian are esteemed most medicinal, which are
      dug up in Oxfordshire and Glocestershire: And therefore
      why may not the Cortex Salignus, or Cortex
      Anglicanus, have its favourite soil, Where it may florish
      most, and, attain to its highest perfection? It is very
      probable that it hath 3 and perhaps it may be in the
      fens of Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Kent, or
      some such like situations; and, though the bark, which
      grew in the county of Oxford, may seem in some
      particular cases to be a little inferior to the quinquina,
      yet, in other places, it may equal, if not exceed it.
    </p><p>
      The powders made from this bark are at first of a
      light brown, tinged with a dusky yellow, and the
      longer they are kept, the more they incline to a
      cinnamon or lateritious colour, which I believe is the
      case with the Peruvian bark and powders.
    </p><p>
      I have no other motives for publishing this valuable
      specific, than that it may have a fair and full trial
      in all its variety of circumstances and situations, and
      that the world may reap the benefits accruing from
      it. For these purposes I have given this long and
      minute account of it, and which I would not have
      troubled your Lordship with, was I not fully persuaded
      of the wonderful efficacy of this Cortex Salignus
      in agues and intermitting cases, and did I not think,
      that this persuasion was sufficiently supported by the
      manifold experience, which I have had of it.
    </p><p>
      I am, my Lord,<br>
      with the profoundest submission and respect,<br>
      your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant<br>
      Edward Stone.<br>
      Chipping-Norton, Oxfordshire<br>
      April 25, 1763.<br>
