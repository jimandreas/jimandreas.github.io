        XXXII. An Account of the Success of the
        Bark of the Willow in the Cure of Agues.
        In a Letter to the Right Honourable George
        Earl of Macclesfield, President of R.S.
        from the Ref. Mr. Edmund Stone, of
        Chipping-Norton in Oxfordshire.
        [Read June 2nd, 1763]
      </em>
      <br>
      My Lord,
      <p>
        Among the many useful discoveries,
        which this age hath made, there
        are very few which, better deserve the attention of the
        public than what I am going to lay before your
        Lordship.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a bark of an English tree, which I have
        found by experience to be a powerful astringent, and
        very efficacious in curing aguish and intermitting
        disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
        About six years ago, I accidentally tasted it, was
        surprised at its extraordinary bitterness; which immediately
        raised me a suspicion of its having the
        properties of the Peruvian bark. As this tree delights
        in a moist or wet soil, where agues chiefly abound,
        the general maxim, that many natural maladies carry
        their cures along with them; or that their remedies
        lie not far from their causes, was so very apposite to
        this particular case, that I could not help applying it;
        and that this might be the intention of Providence here,
        I must own had some little weight with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The excessive plenty of this bark furnished
        me, in my speculative disquisitions upon it, with an argument
        both for and against the imaginary qualities
        of it; for, on one hand, as intermittents are
        very common, it was reasonable to suppose, that what
        was designed for their cure, should be as common and
        as easy to be procured. But then, on the other hand,
        it seemed probable, that, if there was any considerable
        virtue in this bark, it must have been discovered from
        its plenty. My curiosity prompted me to look into
        into the dispensatories and books of botany, and examine
        what they said concerning it; but there it existed
        only by name. I could not find, that it hath, or
        ever had, any place in pharmacy, or any such qualities,
        as I suspected ascribed to it by the botanists.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I determined to make some experiments
        with it; and, for this purpose, I gathered that summer
        near a pound weight of it, which I dryed in a bag,
        upon the outside of a bakerâ€™s oven, for more than three
        months, at which time it was to be reduced to a powder,
        by pounding and sifting after the manner
        that other barks are pulverized.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not long before I had an opportunity of
        making a trial of it; but, being an entire stranger to its
        nature, I gave it in very small quantities, I think it
        was about twenty grains of the powder at a dose, and
        repeated it every four hours between the fits; but with
        great caution and the strictest attention to its effects:
        the fits were considerably abated, but did not entirely
        cease. Not perceiving the least ill consequences, I grew
        bolder with it, and-in a few days encreased the dose
        to two scruples, and the ague was soon removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was then given to several others with the same
        success; but I found it better answered the intention,
        when a dram of it was taken every four hours in the
        intervals of the paroxisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have continued to use it as a remedy for agues
        and intermitting disorders for five years successively
        and successfully. It hath been given I believe to fifty
        persons, and never failed in the cure, except in a few
        autumual and quartan agues, with which the patients
        had been long and severely afflicted; these it reduced
        in a great degree, but did not wholly take them off;
        the patient, at the usual time for the return of his fit,
        felt some smattering of his distemper, which the incessant
        repetition of these powders could not conquer :
        it seemed as if their power could reach thus far
        and no farther, and I did suppose that it would not
        have long continued to reach so far, and that the distemper
        would have soon returned with its pristine
        violence; but I did not stay to see the issue: I added
        one fifth part of the Peruvian bark to it, and with
        this small auxiliary it totally routed its adversary.
        It was found necessary likewise, in one or two obstinate
        cases, at other times of the year, to mix the same
        quantity of that bark with it; but these were cases
        where the patient went abroad imprudently, and,
        caught cold, as a post-chaise boy did, who, being
        almost recovered from an inveterate tertian ague,
        .would follow his business, by which means he not
        only neglected his powders, but, meeting with bad
        weather, renewed his distemper.
      </p>
      <p>
        One fifth part was the largest and indeed the only
        proportion of the quinquina made use of in this
        composition, and this only upon extraordinary occasions:
        the patient was never prepared, either by vomiting,
        bleeding, purging, or any medicines of a
        similar intention, for the reception of this bark, but
        he entered upon it abruptly and immediately, and it.
        was always given in powders, with any common vehicle,
        as water, tea, small beer and such like. This
        was done purely to ascertain its effects; and that I
        might be assured the changes wrought in the patient
        could not be attributed to any other thing: though,
        had there been a due preparation, the most obstinate
        intermittents would probably have yielded to this bark
        without any foreign assistance: And, by all I can
        judge from five years experience of it upon a number
        of persons, it appears to be a powerful absorbent,
        astringent, and febrifuge in intermitting cases, of the
        same nature and kind with the Peruvian bark, and to
        have all its properties, though perhaps not always in
        in the same degree. It seems likewise to have this additional
        quality, viz. to be a safe medicine; for I never
        could perceive the least ill effect from it, though it
        had been always given without any preparation of
        the patient.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tree, from which this bark is taken, is stiled
        by Ray, in his Synopsis, Salix, alba, vulgaris, the
        common white Willow. Haec omnium nobis cognitarum
        maxima est, et in satis crassam et proceram Arborem adolescit.
        [Google translate: This is the largest known to us all, and quite thick timber tree grows.]
      </p>
      <p>
        It is called in these parts, by the common people,
        the willow, and sometimes the Dutch willow; but,
        if it be of a foreign extraction, it hath been so long
        naturalized to this climate, that it thrives as well a
        in it as if it was in its original soil. It is easily distinguished
        by the notable bitterness and the free running
        of its bark, which may be readily separated from it
        all the summer months whilst the sap is up. I took
        it from the shoots of three or four years growth, that
        sprung from Pollard trees, the diameters of which
        shoots, at their biggest end, were from one to four or
        five inches: it is possible, and indeed not improbable,
        that this cortex, taken from larger or older shoots, or
        from the trunk of the tree itself, may be stronger;
        but l have not had time nor opportunities to make
        the experiments, which ought to be made upon it.
        The bark, I had, was gathered in the northern parts
        of Oxfordshire, which are chiefly of dry and gravelly
        nature, affording few moist or moory places for this
        tree to grow in; and therefore, I suspect that its bark
        is not so good here as in some other parts of the kingdom.
        Few vegetables are equal in every place; all
        have their peculiar soils, where they arrive to a greater
        perfection than in any other place: the best and
        strongest Mustard-seed is gathered in the county of
        Durham; the finest Saffron-Flowers are produced
        in some particular spots of Essex and Cambridgeshire;
        the best Cyder-apples grow in Herfordshire, Devonshire
        and the adjacent counties; the roots of
        Valerian are esteemed most medicinal, which are
        dug up in Oxfordshire and Glocestershire: And therefore
        why may not the Cortex Salignus, or Cortex
        Anglicanus, have its favourite soil, Where it may florish
        most, and, attain to its highest perfection? It is very
        probable that it hath 3 and perhaps it may be in the
        fens of Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Kent, or
        some such like situations; and, though the bark, which
        grew in the county of Oxford, may seem in some
        particular cases to be a little inferior to the quinquina,
        yet, in other places, it may equal, if not exceed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The powders made from this bark are at first of a
        light brown, tinged with a dusky yellow, and the
        longer they are kept, the more they incline to a
        cinnamon or lateritious colour, which I believe is the
        case with the Peruvian bark and powders.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no other motives for publishing this valuable
        specific, than that it may have a fair and full trial
        in all its variety of circumstances and situations, and
        that the world may reap the benefits accruing from
        it. For these purposes I have given this long and
        minute account of it, and which I would not have
        troubled your Lordship with, was I not fully persuaded
        of the wonderful efficacy of this Cortex Salignus
        in agues and intermitting cases, and did I not think,
        that this persuasion was sufficiently supported by the
        manifold experience, which I have had of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am, my Lord,<br>
        with the profoundest submission and respect,<br>
        your Lordshipâ€™s most obedient humble Servant<br>
        Edward Stone.<br>
        Chipping-Norton, Oxfordshire<br>
        April 25, 1763.<br>
