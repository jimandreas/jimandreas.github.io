The Molecule of the Month series has been now assembled for almost 20 years. I have been a fan of the series for many years. I must admit that the sheer volume of work and detail exposed could keep me busy reading for all of my time.

In short, the style of explaining and the inspiration that the content gives me drives me to keep thinking about the deeper mysteries in and science of molecular biology, and to keep driving to understand and develop ways that might help me to understand how things work in this realm.

There is a nicely formatted overview available at the following link that describes the intention of Molecule of the Month as well as showcasing the art and science behind the effort:
