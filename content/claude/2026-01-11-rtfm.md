The realization has been around for a while, but
the reality of the paradigm shift should now be
clear even to the most obtuse of geeks, such as
myself. 

Who uses manuals anymore?  

Gone are the days and hours of groveling through
the system documentation looking for that nugget
of information that will help understand the
latest obscure change to your favorite system.
You are groveling not because you want to,
or because you have infinite spare time to 
oborb more arcane system features, but because 
your favorite system insists that some feature 
in your decade old project has now the 
much feared *DEPRECATED* label on it, and 
you *HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT*.

But that has changed a couple of times.

For a while now - you can ask your favorite LLM
some leading questions, such as what the heck is the
new feature and how do I get from my old
implementation to the new one?  And as a result 
one doesn't have to grovel through the documentation
quite as much.

But the second change, and this is my epiphany,
as that I can ask Claude Opus 4.5 to just do the change
*for me* as I sit back and manage it.

The tipping point for me occurred today - as I dared to 
ask Claude Opus CLI to do the conversion from 
".gradle" files to ".kts" type build instructions, 
and this includes the *dreaded* (at least be me) conversion
of the dependency list into the "libs.versions.toml"
format.  My thinking today is that this format
was designed by a computer language type in some
sort of strange way.  So of course I asked an LLM. 
My Claude acount is of course used up until 4PM today,
so I filled in asking ChatGPT.  It suggests that "libs.versions.toml" is:

```
❌ Not designed to torment humans

❌ Not designed purely for algorithms

✅ Designed for human teams + tooling

⚠️ Individually unpleasant without IDEs or AI help
```

But now I don't really care.  As ChatGPT noted, the file
syntax is just fine for LLMs.  And that takes the
torment out of the picture.  

And gives me hope.  The 12 days of Claude Opus CLI
experience suggests there is a way to ride 
this paradigm shift and try to stay "above the API"
as explained so well, and scarily, by Peter Reinhardt in his 2015 essay "[Replacing Middle Management with APIs](https://rein.pk/replacing-middle-management-with-apis)".
